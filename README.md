# ftr-ui

Frontend for the Financial Tracker app (FTR). I am developing this as a side project to practice working with UI frameworks and build something I would use in my day to day to replace whiteboarding my finances.

## How it works

The app will feature a whiteboard style tracking, to simulate writing finances down on a whiteboard. At the top will be your total for a paycheck cycle, and then you can add expenses (or more income) from there. It will deduct from your remaining money for the cycle as you go, letting you keep track of the amount you have left to spend in a cycle.

Example:

```
1/1 Pay Period
--------------
$ 2000
-   20 | Drinks
-------
$ 1980
-   80 | Phone Bill
--------
$ 1900
```

## Techstack

- React
- Typescript
- Vite
- React Router
- ESLint (w/ recommended plugins)
- shadcn
  - components

## Coming Soon

- Home page where you can apply income and expenses
- Pay period tracking with history
- Plan recurring expendes (i.e. bills on certain dates each month)
- Deployable and usable at a domain (timeline TBD)

## AI Disclosure

I find it important to be transparent that frontend isnt my specialty and is activly a learning point for me. To help me better understand topics I've aided the use of AI to correct mistakes, however active development is being done by myself with as minimal intervention as possible from AI tools (Cursor, Copilot) when possible. Im treating this more as a tool to learn for learning frontend thatn just quickly putting things together. If you find things you think could be improved I'm happy to hear about fixing code and learning best practices, thanks!
